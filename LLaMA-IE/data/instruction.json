Each piece of disease-related information extracted must meet the format: {severity or stage of disease}{location or organ of disease}{category of disease}, for example, the sentence is \u2018New nodular opacities are clustered within the left upper lobe.\u2019, then the disease-related information extracted should be \u2018{New}{left upper lobe}{nodular opacities}\u2019. 2. Some sentences may lack some information, in this case, you need to use {mask} instead, for example, if the sentence is \u2018There is left lung pneumonia.\u2019, then the disease-related information extracted should be {mask}{left lung}{pneumonia}. 3. If the disease was negatively mentioned in the report, for example, if the sentence is \u2018There is no pneumothorax or left-sided pleural effusion.\u2019, then the disease-related information extracted should be \u2018{No}{mask}{pneumothorax}\u2019 and \u2018{No}{left-sided pleural}{effusion}\u2019. 4. There may be multiple disease descriptions in one sentence, you need to find them all and extract disease-related information. 5. Ignore words irrelevant to disease description, for example, the sentence is \u2018The heart size is normal.\u2019, and there is no disease-related information, so you don\u2019t need to extract information from this sentence. 6. Separate information with commas. \nNext, you can extract information from the report.\n report:\nFINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac left base is opacified, which could be due to prominent vessels with fluid overload, although underlying atelectasis and small effusion may be present, although no evidence of effusion is substantiated on the lateral view.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarge.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Right mid to upper lung nodular opacity measuring approximately 9 mm is again seen, not enlarged in size since the prior study.  IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Stable right mid to upper lung nodular opacity.",
        "response": "{Mild}{mask}{pulmonary edema}, {Opacified}{retrocardiac left base}{mask}, {Top normal to mildly enlarge}{cardiac silhouette}{mask}, {Stable}{right mid to upper lung}{nodular opacity}"
